## Homework 3

# Part 1. Setup

```{r}
# read in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(flextable)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(officer)

# read in personal data
mydata <- read_csv("data/Personal Data Project - Sheet1.csv")
```

# Part 2. Problems

## a.

To summarize the data and compare a response variable between categories, I could calculate the pages per minute for each session to compare reading effectiveness across different locations. This comparison would be informative because different environments might offer varying levels of comfort or light, which could impact my focus, and consequently, how well I understood the material.

## b.

```{r}
df <- clean_names(mydata) |> # clean column names
  # adding pages_per_minute column
  mutate(pages_per_minute = ifelse(total_time_of_reading > 0,  number_of_pages / total_time_of_reading, 0))

mean_pages_per_minute <- df |> # create new data frame for mean pages per minute
  group_by(location) |> # group by location
  summarise(Mean_PPM = mean(pages_per_minute)) |> # calculate the mean
  rename("Location" = location) # rename the location to be capitalized

ggplot(df, # plotting the data
       aes(x = location, # location on x axis
               y = pages_per_minute)) + # Pages per minute on the y axis
         geom_boxplot(aes(fill = location)) + # creating boxplot
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 1, color = "black", alpha = 0.7) + # adding the underlying data
  scale_fill_manual(values = c( # add different colors than default
    "Balcony" = "#1f77b4", # blue for balcony
    "Bed" = "#ff7f0e" # orange for bed
  )) +
  theme_bw() + # add theme for aesthetics
  labs( # label function to rename labels
    x = "Reading Location", # new x axis title
    y = "Pages Per Minute", # new y axis title
    title = "Reading Efficiency (Pages Per Minute) by Location" # title for visualization
  )
```

## c.

Figure 1. Reading Efficiency (Pages Per Minute) by Location. Box plots display the distribution and summary statistics of reading efficiency at two locations: the balcony and the bed. While both locations show similar median reading speeds, the balcony shows a tighter distribution compared to the wider spread of values observed for reading in bed.

## d.

```{r}
table1 <- flextable(mean_pages_per_minute) |> # create table using flextable
  colformat_double(j = "Mean_PPM", digits = 1) |> # rounding to nearest decimal
  autofit() |> # autofit function to make everything fit
  theme_zebra() |> # theme
  align(align = "center", part = "all") |> # center align all parts of the table
  border_outer(border = fp_border(color = "black", width = 2)) |> # adding outer border
  border_inner(border = fp_border(color = "grey", width = 1)) # adding inner border

table1 # displaying the table
```

# Problen 2, Affective visualization

## a. 

An affective visualization for my personal reading data project can be visually represented with orbs in a jar, where each orb represents an individual reading session. The color of the orb can represent the comprehension: vibrant green colors for high comprehension, fading from purple to muddy brown hues for low comprehension. The surface of the orb can represent the distractions, becoming rougher, more jagged as the number of distractions grows. Also, the total time spent reading can be represented through the size of the orb.

## b.

## c.

## d.

My affective visualization shows a jar containing many orbs. Each orb is an independent reading session, which is affected by length of reading, comprehension, and distractions. I took inspiration from the examples provided of Jill Pelto's paintings. I drew my peice on my iPad. I started off with a drawing of a jar. I then filled the jar with different size orbs that represent different sessions of reading. Each orb is to be different in size, color, and defects on the surface.

# Problem 3. Statistical Critique

## a.

The statistical tests used by the author to address their main research question are: Welch’s t-test, Mann–Whitney’s U-test, Kruskal–Wallis test, Spearman’s correlation coefficient by rank test.

## b.

The author clearly represents their statistics in the figure, with well labeled axes and depth scale that increases downwards. Each of the four species include test statistics such as medians, standard deviations, interquartile ranges, and depth extremes. P-values from Kruskal–Wallis tests are clearly displayed, making statistical comparisons across regions clear and easy to interpret.


## c.

The author handles visual clutter well by using distinct, consistent symbols (open circles, closed circles, triangles, box plots) and seperating each species into their own panel. The data:ink ratio is high, but the visual elements have meaningful information (depth ranges, medians, p-values). Overall, this figure is information dense yet clear and visually effective.

## d.

I would recommend adding a sample size for each box plot in the legend, which can help readers evaluate the variability of the summary statistics. Instead of using open and closed circles to differentiate between night and day, I would recommend adding color to enhance the immediate visual distinction without overwhelming the figure, I would add clarity in the legend, specifically the triangles and boxes to make it easier to understand what they represent. Lastly, a summary of the findings at the bottom of the figure that quickly helps the reader grasp significant patterns without having to interpret each subplot individually.
